        There’s something special about the way the community supports small businesses in Alphabet City, an area on the 
        east side of Lower Manhattan in New York. But when <br>foot traffic was unexpectedly eliminated, neighborhood 
        institutions like <a href="https://www.abcbeer.co/">ABC Beer Company </a>had to get creative and adapt.
    </p>   
    
    <p>
        In 2012, when Zach Mack and David Hitchner opened ABC, a bar and retail beer store, they received a pretty harsh
         welcome message: Hurricane Sandy. The Hurricane <br>  made landfall in  New York City just one week after they opened,
         leaving many, including ABC, without any power and with extensive property damage.
        They were able<br>  to quickly clean up the damage and open up shop,  for the second time, just a few days later.
    </p>

    <p>
        Having already experienced one natural disaster, Zach and David didn’t panic when COVID-19 arrived in NYC.
         Thankfully, the governor designated liquor stores <br> essential businesses, so they could remain open for patrons
          to purchase beer. “We had to have a very sudden conversation that we were both on the same page about, 
          which<br> was  making sure that we keep our employees and customers safe first and foremost, and that we were
           able to serve the community in some way.”
    </p>
    <p>
        They expanded their existing snack selection to include basic grocery items like pasta and milk to make it 
        easier for locals to minimize their shopping time. Because they have <br> a loyal group of regular patrons at the
         bar, the ABC team knew they could rely on a steady stream of local delivery and pick-up orders to help 
         support their business during <br> an uncertain time. But in order to keep the business running, they’d need 
         to think bigger than just the confines of Alphabet City, which meant launching their out-of-state <br> delivery option.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Following Covid, we were seeing between a quarter to a third of our sales go online. It really helped soften the 
        blow from losing all the draft beer sales”
    </p>
    <p>Launching national shipping was no easy task–the regulations around shipping alcohol differ from state to state in 
        the U.S.–but in order to ensure that they could rely <br> on this new revenue stream, in addition to their impressive
         selection of beer, ABC needed to make sure their brand was visually appealing to both new and existing customers.

    </p>
    <p>
        Working closely with seller <a href=https://www.fiverr.com/coljamz?/?utm_source=brand&utm_medium=brand&utm_campaign=
        theshift&utm_content=ABC">coljamz</a>, a graphic designer also based in NYC, Zach and David were able to collaborate
         on a new visual identity for the store. ABC worked directly <br> with the Seller on a variety of different artistic
          directions for their new logo. “I was blown away by how quickly our logo prospects came back from him, it was
           days.” <br> Once they settled on a new logo, coljamz created a comprehensive brand identity with new colors and 
           visual guidelines to implement across their website and social media.
    </p>
    <p>
        With a new brand identity, ABC worked with digital marketing expert <a href="#"
        >sharonthony</a> to create a new social 
        media strategy to attract a new audience of customers, not just in <br> NYC but across the whole country. With sharonthony’s
         help, they created a series of Instagram and Facebook ads to share with the right audience of prospective customers.
    </p>
    <p>Even as bars like ABC start offering outdoor seating in NYC, Zach and David have no plans of slowing down their
         expansion into online sales. They are also planning to <br> update their website, with new product photography and 
         e-commerce platform optimizations. By adapting their retail model, ABC Beer Co. is ready to continue to grow in <br> 
          this new digital normal.
